## Getting Started with Model HQ

After installing the **llmware** application on your system, launch the application. You will be presented with an interface similar to the one shown below:

![landing interface](landing_interface.png)

The application will automatically detect your system information. Click on the `System Info Auto Detected` section to expand it.  
Ensure that your system meets the [Model HQ System Requirements](https://github.com/RS-labhub/ModelHQ-Docs/tree/master/systemConfiguration/SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION.md) before proceeding.

### Setup Options

Once your system compatibility is confirmed, you will be presented with the following setup options:

- **1. Full Setup**  
  This option automatically configures your environment by pre-loading 25 curated models along with a set of test cases.  
  This setup is ideal for Demo set-up and for users who want a ready-to-use environment with minimal manual configuration.  
  _Estimated setup time: ~30 minutes._

- **2. Fast Setup**  
  Quickly set up an environment with a curated selection of 3 small models to get going.  
  _Estimated setup time: ~2-3 minutes._

- **3. No Setup**  
  Customize your environment manually by selecting and configuring only the models you need. Recommended for advanced users who prefer full control over their setup. The models will be loaded as they are selected and will take time to load.

- **4. Enterprise Template**  
  Use a pre-configured enterprise-grade template designed to streamline deployment across large teams. Best suited for organizational adoption with minimal configuration overhead.

## Getting Started with Full Setup
The **Full Setup** option allows you to configure Model HQ with a comprehensive environment that includes 25 of the most accurate and powerful models available. This setup is ideal for users who want to get started without any custom configuration. We recommend this for DEMOs. This set up still allows for other models to be added when selected.  
This documentation outlines what the Full Setup process includes and how to get started.

1. On the setup options screen, select the `Full Setup` option and click the `>` button to proceed.

2. To use this option, it is important that you configure your laptop or PC setting as shown in the [Set-Up Guide], so that you adjust the screen, sleep and hibernate time-outs to at least 2 hours so that screen timeouts do not interrupt the initial model download.
    
3. You will be presented with a screen displaying the list of models that will be downloaded as part of the setup.  
   Review the list, and optionally deselect any models you do not wish to include to reduce setup time.  
   Once satisfied with the selection, click `>` to begin the download process. (it will typically takes ~30 minutes if you download all the listed models, depending on your Wi-Fi speed)  
   Choose the source for model downloads — either **Azure** (recommended) or **Hugging Face**. Once ready, click `>`.

## Getting Started with Fast Setup
