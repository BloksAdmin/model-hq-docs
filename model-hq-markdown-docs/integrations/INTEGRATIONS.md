If the test succeeds, the integration is active. If it fails, review the error message and verify credentials and network settings.

### Security and data handling
- No data is leaving your app.
- Credentials are stored locally in your Model HQ app.
- Model HQ does not share credentials with third parties without explicit consent. When enabling integrations that require external access, follow your organizationâ€™s security policy.
- For sensitive systems (financial, production data, support systems), consult your security team before enabling access.

### Troubleshooting
- Verify that API keys, tokens, and URLs match the values provided by the service.
- Confirm network connectivity and any required firewall or allowlist configuration.
- Review logs or the Test operation error messages for diagnostic information.

### Conclusion
Model HQ integrations enable connections to external data sources and services in a secure, auditable way. Use the Manage Integrations and Credentials Handling interfaces to add, verify, and administer connectors.
