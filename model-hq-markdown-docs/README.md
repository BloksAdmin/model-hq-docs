## HOW TO CONTRIBUTUE
- Make edits in the respected doc files. Every section documentation is their respected folder. For ex: if you want to make edits in Agents, then move to agents folder.
- If you want to ADD A NEW DOCUMENTATION (not listed in the present one), then
  - create a new folder, if that section is covering a whole new thing. Like `model-hq-markdown-docs/newDoc/NEW.md`
  - create a new markdown file, if there are new feature added in one of the existing sections. Like `model-hq-markdown-docs/agent/AGENT_NEW.md`
- The changes you make will be on the markdown only. IF YOU WANT TO UPDATE THE WEBSITE, THEN YOU HAVE TO ADD THE CHANGES OR EDITS IN THE RESPECTED TS FILES. For example, If you want to add the changes in the website that are done in the markdown, then go to `app/agent/file_name`. If there's anything new, then create a proper file and do it.

**USE v0 BY VERCEL TO CONVERT MARKDOWN INTO THE TS. IT'S SAME LIKE CHATGPT BUT MOSTLY USED FOR CREATING BEAUTIFUL UIs. I HAVE ALREADY SETUP THE WHOLE DOCUMENTATION THERE. FOLLOW THE BELOW STEPS TO CONVERT IT PROPERLY IN A SINGLE GO**:
- Attach your markdown file in the v0.
- Attach any reference file (it can be any, just copy any of the previous ts page link like tools, and paste it in the v0 chat).
- Use this prompt: Convert/Update this markdown file according to the `reference_used`(for ex: tools) reference attached.
- Copy the code, and add in the respected TS folder.
