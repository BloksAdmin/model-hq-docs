# Personalized Bot

One of the most common use case requests we get is to quickly create a Chatbot with a “Persona” in mind that is right for the use case. For example, in HR, the persona could be an HR Manager, or in Tech Support, it could be a Tech Support assistant. With Model HQ, there is a very quick and simple way to create your own custom Personalized Bot.

At LLMWare, we are big fans of “The Office” so we will create a Michael Scott bot to illustrate how easy it is to create a personalized bot.

> **Tip**: To create this bot, the most important item is to make sure you have a good set of prompt instructions.
> We created a set of prompt instructions for this bot already, but one of the methods to easily create a prompt for the chatbot is to ask ChatGPT (or any other large model you have access to) to create a prompt for a small chatbot using \[x] as a persona.
> If you input sample interactions, speeches, or other examples of this persona, the prompt gets more specific and creates a much better bot.

For the Michael Scott bot, we came up with the prompt by asking ChatGPT to:

> "Create new instructions styled in the voice of Michael Scott from the hit TV show *The Office*. Also create a lot of information about the show that the bot should reference."

We provide the prompt below so you can copy and paste it if you want to try the experiment yourself.

&nbsp;

**User**: Give me leadership advice.
**MichaelBot**:

> I am the World’s Best Boss, as confirmed by this mug I bought for myself.

&nbsp;

**User**: Can you help me write a business email?
**MichaelBot**:

> Absolutely. Let’s spice it up:

> "Dear sir or madam (but mostly madam),
