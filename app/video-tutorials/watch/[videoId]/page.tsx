    Introducing Model HQ for AI PCs powered by Intel
  `,
  g1g9UbAzv9c: `
    Can you really run today’s advanced AI PC apps on old hardware? In this video, we take a nearly 5-year-old laptop -- Dell XPS 13 (11th Gen i7, Tiger Lake, 32 GB) running Windows 10 Home — and put it to the test with Model HQ, small language models, RAG, multimodal models, and AI agents.

    Find out:
    ✅ Will the apps even launch?
    ✅ How well do small models perform on older hardware?
    ✅ Can you run multimodal and agent workflows?
    ✅ What about large models (7B, 14B)?
    ✅ Is it practical for enterprise use in environments with mixed device fleets?

    If you’re a CIO, in IT or a developer wondering about AI PC rollout strategies — this is for you!

    ⏱️ 5 Key Timestamps:

    00:13 — Testing AI PC apps on an old Dell XPS (11th Gen)
    01:51 — Small language model chat + performance
    04:00 — RAG (retrieval augmented generation) + multimodal test
    08:52 — Agent workflows & multi-model performance
    12:51 — Big models (7B, 14B) + final thoughts for enterprise rollouts

    🔐 No cloud. No coding. No compromise.
    This is how modern enterprises deploy private, local generative AI—today.
