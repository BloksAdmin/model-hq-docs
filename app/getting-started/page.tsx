        <p>Once your system compatibility is confirmed, you will be presented with the following setup options:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1. Full Setup</strong>
            <br />
            This option automatically configures your environment by pre-loading 25 curated models along with a set of
            test cases.
            <br />
            This setup is ideal for Demo set-up and for users who want a ready-to-use environment with minimal manual
            configuration.
            <br />
            <em>Estimated setup time: ~30 minutes.</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2. Fast Setup</strong>
            <br />
            Quickly set up an environment with a curated selection of 3 small models to get going.
            <br />
            <em>Estimated setup time: ~2-3 minutes.</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3. No Setup</strong>
            <br />
            Customize your environment manually by selecting and configuring only the models you need. Recommended for
            advanced users who prefer full control over their setup. The models will be loaded as they are selected and
            will take time to load.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>4. Enterprise Template</strong>
            <br />
            Use a pre-configured enterprise-grade template designed to streamline deployment across large teams. Best
            suited for organizational adoption with minimal configuration overhead.

          The <strong>Full Setup</strong> option allows you to configure Model HQ with a comprehensive environment that
          includes 25 of the most accurate and powerful models available. This setup is ideal for users who want to get
          started without any custom configuration. We recommend this for DEMOs. This set up still allows for other
          models to be added when selected.
          <br />
          This documentation outlines what the Full Setup process includes and how to get started.
