                You agree to not rely on any information generated from these models, whether provided by us or by other
                vendors. While we provide "evidence-based" AI to assist users in assessing the accuracy of certain
                information, we do not guarantee that we can provide you with the correct or necessary information to
                make such assessments, and any such "evidence" we extract from user libraries is to be used only as an
                aid. We recommend that users perform independent verification before relying on any such information and

              From time to time, we may release products or new features that we will be testing and evaluating ("Beta

              You and we agree to be bound by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) rules which will administer the
              arbitration under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration
              fees. The costs and fees of arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's
              rules, including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              The exception to the agreement to arbitrate applies where we bring a lawsuit for the purpose of injunctive
              relief to stop the unauthorized use or abuse of Software, intellectual property infringement (for example,
              but not limited to, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in
              arbitration or the informal dispute resolution process described above. If the agreement to arbitrate is
              found not to apply to you or your claim, you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal
              courts in Fairfield County, Connecticut to resolve your claim.

              You agree that you may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as
              a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations,
              class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren't allowed.

              If any part of this or other sections are found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain
              in effect, in its entirety. If you are found to have a non-waivable right to bring a particular claim or
              to request a particular form of relief that the arbitrator lacks authority to redress or award according
              to this section, including public injunctive relief, then only that respective claim or request for relief
              may be brought in court, and you and we agree that litigation of any such claim or request for relief
              shall be stayed pending the resolution of any individual claim(s) or request(s) for relief in arbitration.

              These Terms will be governed by Connecticut law except for its conflicts of laws principles. However, some
              countries have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer's country.
              This paragraph doesn't override those laws.

            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              Our failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found
              unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term
              will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights
              under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. AI Bloks may assign its rights to any of its
              affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Software.
